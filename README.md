# TOGT-Planner

**Time-Optimal Gate-Traversing (TOGT) Planner** is a lightweight trajectory generator for racing drones that can accommodate a broad range of race tracks comprising gates with diverse shapes and sizes. It provides high trajectory quality in terms of dynamic feasibility by employing the differential-flat nature of quadrotor systems and incorporating single-rotor thrust constraints.

## Visualize the TOGT trajectory
The default race track `race_uzh_7g_multiprisma.yaml` contains 7 gates with different shapes, respectively, triangle, rectangle, pentagon, rectangle, rectangle, hexagon, and ball gates in order. The resulting lap time is `8.23` s.
```
cd ../scripts/plots
python3 plot_togt_traj.py
```

## Visualize the TOGT-Refined trajectory
The TOGT trajectory can be refined to reach true time optimality. We take the optimal gate-traversal point as the waypoint and use the obtained time allocation to compute a proper node number for each segment between two consecutive waypoints. Then, we warm-start the multiple-shooting method with the planned TOGT trajectory. The following Python script conducts the refinement for us. The resulting lap time is `7.01` s.
```
cd ../scripts/togt_refine
python3 togt_refine.py
cd ../plots
python3 plot_togt_refined_traj.py

## Visualize the AOS trajectory for waypoint flight

Another example is the Split-S track provided in [this](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.abh1221) paper. It consists of 19 waypoints in total with a tolerance of 0.3 m for each point. Below is our generated trajectory. The AOS stands for Automatic Optimal Synthesis, a novel framework to address time-optimal planning problems. It is part of the result from the second reference above. It takes around 6 seconds to solve the minimum-time trajectory that originally required \~50 minutes in previous methods. The resulting lap time is only 1\~2% longer than the optimal solution. We will provide an in-depth analytical analysis in the paper about its distance-insensitive nature. The resulting lap time is `17.93` s while the true optimal is `17.56` s.

## Visualize the AOS-TOGT trajectory

The TOGT and AOS planners can be seamlessly integrated, contributing to a highly efficient and accurate method to solve the time-optimal gate-traversing problem. The code below can visualize the result. The resulting lap time is `16.83` s, which is 4% faster than time-optimal waypoint flights.
