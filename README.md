# TOGT-Planner

**Time-Optimal Gate-Traversing (TOGT) Planner** is a light-weight racing trajectory generator that can accommondate a broad range of race tracks comprising gates with diverse shapes and sizes. It provides high trajectory quality in terms of dynamically feasibility by employing differential-flat nature of quadrotor systems and incorporating single-rotor thrust constriants.
